# **Random Password Generator**

## **Introduction**

The purpose of this project is to provide a web-based password generator that randomly selects values for the password based on 
criteria selected by the user.

## **Project Description**

The Random Password Generator is a webpage that, once initialized, will prompt the user for a series of responses that will indicate how long of a password the user wants, and whether, or not, the user wants to use upper-case letters, lower-case letter, special characters, and numbers in their password.  

Once the user has responded to all of the prompts, the program will display a password that matches all of the criteria entered by the user.
